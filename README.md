# Welcome to my portfolio:
# My portfolio consists of 4 different parts that include some related projects for each part.


## Data Analysis: 
> This project involved analyzing data from previous United States presidential elections. It provided with data for 2008, 2012 and 2016. In this project you will see 3 parts that are introduced in more detail in below:
>> **•	Part 1.** The main purpose of this part is more about cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

>> **•	Part 2.** In this part, we are going to see more statistical analysis from basic to more advanced on the data and visualization.

>> **•	Part 3.** After doing parts 1 and 2, now we are able to use the statistical results for making a prediction using some machine learning methodology like regressions.

## SQL:
> In this project, the goal is to gain a high-level understanding of how people use Bixi bikes, what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations, and overall business growth. 

> **YOU CAN FIND THIS PROJECT FROM 2 DIFFERENT PDF FILES:**
>> **1.**	The description and conclusion from the file named: Bixi_project.pdf

>> **2.**	The SQL scripts from the file named: SQL Script – Bixi.pdf

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

## Machine Learning:
> All the projects consist of three steps:
>> **1.**	Cleaning and preprocessing the datasets

>> **2.**	Visualizing

>> **3.**	Fit and train models

### •	E-commerce Customers Clustering: 

> In this project you are going to see:
>> **1.**	The unsupervised customers clustering based on their information (using K-means Clustering)

>> **2.**	An observation on the sales during a year 

>> **3.**	a trained model that predict the customers’ reviews based on their sentiment values (using Random forest, NLP, TFIDF, and BOW)

### •	The Handwritten Digit Recognizer: 

> The main goal of this project is to train different models to predict the MNIST data (Modified version of the data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology). In this project the methodologies used are:

>> **1.**	PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

>> **2.**	KNN

>> **3.**	Logistic Regression

### •	Sentiment Analysis: 

> This project that you are going to see, provides the isight of Amazon Products reviews, analyze the sentiment of customers, summary of statistical data, data viualization, and fit the model using random forest.
